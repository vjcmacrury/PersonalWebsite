    <p>My name is Vanessa Jade Cantos-MacRury and I am a unifier, able to see
        the different strands in a situation, and reason out a way to draw them
        together. I believe every experience, no matter how mundane, brings
        something of value and that life needs to be experienced in order to be
        lived. <br> <br> To this end, I have collected experiences. Thirteen
        years in customer service. Two years in official and eleven in
        unofficial but equally relevant IT support roles. I've been a leader, a
        teacher, a coach, a writer, an editor, a photojournalist, a student, a
        mentee, a researcher. <br> <br> I'm an extensive traveller, a dreamer and a dreamcatcher
         - having gone to nearly every single country I've dreamed of visiting
        as a child and achieved nearly every single dream. <br> <br> Speaking of
        dreams, what's a girl to do when she doesn't have a drop of royal blood
        but wants to be royalty? As Jim Rohn said, "move, you're not a tree."
        I now live in the Kingdom of Fife.</p>
